# Shadowgun: Legends v0.4.2 Aimbot

### Made by shmoo @hackedbyshmoo

This aimbot is for educational purposes only. I purposely left out class implementations for Vector3 and Quaternion. You can write those yourself. There's also implementation for Quaternion::LookRotation online.
I included the dump for reference. Enjoy!
